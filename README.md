# Web-scraping
This is a program for scrapping key information points about hashtags from the hastag pages of instagram.

## About
- The main file that is to be run is **insta_scrap.py** and wiki_scrapping_food.py and insta_tags.py are the supporting file.
- **wiki_scrapping_food.py** makes a list of food names which can be possible tag names.
- **insta_tags.py** makes a class for instagram tags for easier handling of information. 

## Salient Feature
- According to what I have analysed on instagram site till now, all the web elements have distinct classes and the same code can be used to extract any element from any instagram page. So, that means that all the photos have the same class and the image scrapping part can scrap images from any instagram page.

## Requirement
- chromedriver.exe should be installed and in path.
